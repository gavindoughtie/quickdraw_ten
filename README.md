# quickdraw_ten

This is a small subset of just ten classes from Google's massive QuickDraw dataset found here: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/raw;tab=objects?prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false

Additionally, each file is just 100 randomly selected items.

However, this is the "raw" version of the data which includes timestamps and has not been normalized.
